# Integration with CAS in Liferay 7.4

Liferay CAS client was deprecated from version 7.3 and [removed completely in 7.4](https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/installation-and-upgrades/upgrading-liferay/reference/maintenance-mode-and-deprecations-in-7-4.html#features-deprecated-in-7-4). This repository demonstrates how to bring it back to Liferay.

If you just want to have the CAS working in your portal, download the three attached binaries and put them to your `LIFERAY_HOME/deploy` folder (each release contains Liferay GA and `cas-client-core` versions). 

You can find more information about this repository on a [blog post](https://liferay.dev/blogs/-/blogs/how-to-bring-back-cas-integration-to-liferay-7-4) I published on the Liferay community page.

The file `GETTING_STARTED.markdown` comes with Liferay Workspace by default, and provides some documentation about it (I'm not the author).
